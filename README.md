<!-- The README should clearly explain the purpose of the website, technologies used, and instructions on how to view the website. 

For assignment 1, my personal website is orgaized into 3 different pages- the home page, the resume page, and the visualization page

The home page, which can be navigated to through the nav bar under 'vanessa zwierzchowski' is a home page with a short bio about myself and my work. Including a small graphic I made. 

The experience page (under resume in the nav bar), is a short page describing my experiene with work, where I have gone to school, and my further contact information (with links to my email and LinkdIn).

Lastly, the visualization page (part 2 of the assignment) shows a bar graph svg visualization of "frequency of self-care tasks in the week" that my partner Dana and I created in-class. These tasks include the following: skincare, going to the gym, purchasing food, and washing my hair. 
This bar graph was made up from text, line, and shape fucntions, placed carefully in coordinates. 

The second visualization is a spinning svg triangle animation, which was assisted by AI in order to achieve the correct movement of the triangles I created. Notes were left within the 'animation.js' file and the 'style.css' where AI specifically helped me learn how to achieve the animation/visualization I wanted.

Other technologies used in this project includes Visual Studio Code, GitKraken, ang GitHub. My website can be publicly seen on https://vzwierz1.github.io/

Overall, the website may be explored using the navigation at the top to click through the 3 pages, thank you! -->
