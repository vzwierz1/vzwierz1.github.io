<!-- The README should clearly explain the purpose of the website, technologies used, and instructions on how to view the website. -->

<!-- For assignment 1, my personal website is orgaized into 3 different pages- the home page, the resume page, and the visualization page -->

<!-- The home page, which can be navigated to through the bav bar under 'vanessa zwierzchowski' is a home page with a short bio about myself and my work.

The experience page, is a short page describing my experiene with work, where I have gone to school, and my further contact information.

Lastly, the visualization page (part 2 of the assignment) shows a bar graph visualization of "frequency of self-care tasks in the week" that my partner Dana and I created in-class.
